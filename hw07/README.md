#### Progress

-   I found this assignment quite tricky. It took me some time to understand how makefile works and the different commands to use.

-   Writing the R scripts weren't too difficult, and I was able to use previous homework assignments to help me out.

-   I referred many times to the [notes](http://stat545.com/hw07_automation.html) and referred to these [notes](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html) for help with statistical analyses.

-   This homework assignment definitely felt like the hardest one of the course so far.
